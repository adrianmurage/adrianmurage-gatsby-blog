In this post, I'll be going over:

* Why I am switching from Jekyll to Gatsby
* The technicalities of the switch
* The gotchas I came across

## Why stop using Jekyll to begin with

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) was actually pretty good for my use case. But eventually, it all boiled down to two simple things. 

1. I wanted to move away from a technical writing process ie. have a CMS where I could quickly write up content.
2. I wanted the possibility of making a really impressive blog one day and the Gatsby option is being used by [JoshComeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) and the React element of Gatsby has the promise to help make that a reality.
3. I vaguely remember trying to set up a CMS for my Jekyll blog and failing. I couldn't find a resource that had a good enough guide at the time. Is there a good chance I just didn't look in the right places? Yes. Am I going to go back there and keep looking? Nop

## Switching over to Gatsby

This part was actually surprisingly easy. I remember looking for React resources or how to create something in react and then finding an article by [Mohammed Asker](https://www.mohammedasker.com/) that walked through [How to Build a Blog with Gatsby and Netlify CMS â€“ A Complete Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-blog-with-gatsby-and-netlify-cms/) and my mind went, "This is something I should do". And so on a random Sunday on week 11/14 of a semester where I have fallen so far behind it's scary, I decided to follow through the article and set up my Gatsby blog.

## Setup gotchas

I came across some of these that I think are worth mentioning.
